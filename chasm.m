function br=chasm(x,draw)
% Bilbo is trying to get across a chasm by building a bridge supported at
% its left end. The input x, which should be a vector of 100 elements,
% describes the thickness of the bridge at each point, which must be
% between 0.2 and 20. Bilbo slowly extends the bridge over the chasm, and
% the return value "br" returns (negative) the maximum length of the bridge 
% before it breaks. Explicitly, this code first checks whether the bridge 
% consisting of just x(100) can support its own weight; if it can, then Bilbo 
% extends the bridge one unit and the code checks if the bridge consisting of
% x(99:100) can support its own weight, etc., with the algorithm returning
% the number of times the bridge was extended before it broke, or 100 if it
% successfully bridged the chasm without breaking.
%
% If you are curious, bridge physics works as follows: the strain induced
% on a bridge segment i of thickness x(i) by having to hold up a second 
% bridge segment j with mass x(j) that is distance (j-i) to the right is
% x(j)hl*(j-i)/x(i). These expressions are summed for all segments to the
% right of i, and if the strain is greater than 300, the bridge breaks at i.
